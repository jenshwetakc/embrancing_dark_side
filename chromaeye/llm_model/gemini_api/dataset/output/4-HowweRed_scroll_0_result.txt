This makes it significantly less prominent than its pure black counterpart in light mode (contrast ratio 21:1) and also less prominent than other major headings in dark mode, such as 'Browsers are sooo out-dated...' (which uses white text, approx. #FFFFFF on #1C1C1E, contrast ratio 15.65:1). This alters the intended visual hierarchy and reduces the heading's emphasis inconsistently.",

In light mode, the icon and text share the same color (black), maintaining a consistent visual relationship. This discrepancy in dark mode makes the icon appear less connected to the text and reduces its relative prominence compared to the light mode version. While the icon's contrast against the background (4.17:1) meets WCAG 1.4.11 minimum for graphical objects, the inconsistency in its relationship with the associated text is a UX concern.",
